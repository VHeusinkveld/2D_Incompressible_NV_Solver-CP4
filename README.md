# Navier-Stokes: NACA-profile objects in 2D flow
## Structure

*navier_stoke.ipynb*: 2D Navier-Stokes solver (FDM) (Initial script, will be removed soon)
*Execute_simulation.ipynb*: Main file which executes the NS simulation. This contains the set-up of the simulation.

*constants.py*: Contains the constants of the system
*data_processing.py*: Contains plotting functions
*functions.py*: Contains all functions needed to perform the simulation (generated the wanted data).
*simulation.py*: Contains the simulation functions of the NS solver
